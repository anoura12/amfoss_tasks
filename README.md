## About The Tasks
The tasks were quite challenging and interesting to do. They thoroughly tested my logic and problem solving skills effectively. As I solved these problems, I learnt a very core skill that is how to efficiently Google errors. It's something that can only be learnt by programming hands on and that's exactly the opportunity that these tasks have given me. Even having solved only a handful of tasks, I can definitively say that I have gained some insight into coding overall.

## Who am I?
Hi! I'm Anoushka Ramesh and I currently reside in Pune, Maharashtra. My native place, however, is in Kerala. I decided to travel all the way to Kollam to join Amrita because I  had heard about the wonderful coding culture there and the abundance of opportunities to learn and thrive in programming. Hence, for a novice programmer like me and a person who is really eager to delve into hands on coding, Amrita sounded like a perfect fit. Frankly speaking, coding to me always sounded like something off of The Matrix. It was highly intriguing but at the same time, looked very complex. As I stepped into it in 9th grade, certain aspects started getting more clear. I realised that it's really all about solving problems. The skill lies in how to approach them. I feel the amFOSS club projects this concept very well. Uptil now, I have only learnt Java and a bit of Python. I have also done a bit of frontend too.( HTML, CSS , JavaScript). I look forward to increasing my skillset with amFOSS.
