# Web Scraping Using Rust
This was by far the most difficult of all the tasks and frankly, took way more time than I had expected. There were a lot of elements that had to be included.
1. Downloading Rust
2. Creating a cargo package
3. Understanding the parts of the program
4. A lot of debugging

There were a lot of errors ( the most errors I have ever encountered) in the program at first. Some of them were downloading packages, updating dependencies, a virtual manifest not allowing dependencies, problems with the async function not being compatible with the main function and many more. One thing I learned was how to google errors. I did develop a lot of patience and will power through this. Overall, this whole task gave me a good experience on how to handle code. 

The code that I have posted in main.rs compiles fine after executing cargo build, but the output is just blank. I feel that the selector that I chose is wrong and even after having tried multiple ways like using SelectorGadget etc.. I couldn't figure out the right selector. The print statements are working fine as well so I guess the main problem is the selector.
