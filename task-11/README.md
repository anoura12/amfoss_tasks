## Poster Design
This was pretty straightforward. I got the mountains and the girl from the net and used Paint to make it look like the girl was sitting. I made the colourful thought bubbles manually through Paint and the elements like the books and microphone etc.. I downloaded .png versions of icons from a site called icons8. This was a lot of fun to make :)
