# Introspection
## Why must we choose you?
Coding looks really intriguing and fascinating to me. Despite being a novice in this arena, it is one aspect of my life that never fails to excite me. I have always been eager to solve problems not only because it sparks so many wonderful ideas and interactive conversations with others but I think it also brings out my creativity in the best possible manner. I strongly believe that the amFOSS club will give me that opportunity to share my creativity and contribute to the projects and the overall culture there. I am also an enthusiastic learner and really do take the time to introspect on my work. I do look forward to boost my current skilsets tenfolds with the amFOSS club and can't wait to be a part of it. 

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
My desired goal for the upcoming months is to get into GSoC. The idea of being able to create a project and being guided by so many people really excited me. The access to a strong community there is also one of the reasons for my said goal. Hence, I wish to finetune both my coding and writing skills with amFOSS.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I remember one of my teachers telling me that if I was able to mentor 5 other people with their work using the knowledge I gained from him and just like that if the process continued, the world would truly be a better place. Similarly, I would love to guide and mentor other students that join the amFOSS club. I would also maintain this lovely culture that the club is known for because along with coding, the club really shines because of the people. So, I will make it a priority to get the right kind of people in the club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection process is quite intense but for good reason. It's a good filter to ensure that the right people come in. Maybe one suggestion I could give you is to check whether the resources are up to date. I'm not generalising this for all of the resource links and infact, some of them were quite informative and to the point. It's just one or two links that I felt were outdated. Like for example, one of the links for the rust task had a bit of outdated reference code. Obviously after more googling I could find what I was looking for but this is something that I had in mind and wanted to share.
