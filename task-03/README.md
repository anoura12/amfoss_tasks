# HackerRank Tasks
## Great Eye
This task can broken down into two simple conditions:-
1. Either the number the user entered exists as one of the positions of the word in the sentence. (Basically then find ascii sum of the values)
2. The number doesn't exist as a position. (Print -1)

A simple for loop through the string allowed me to extract each letter of the word and ultimately its ascii value.
