# Debugging Derbies
I believe finding out the errors was the easy part as it involved only the following types of errors:-
1. Syntax i.e. missing semicolins , removing the comment for an import statement
2. Logical i.e counter-- was there instead of counter++, mix up of operators, start & stop buttons mixed up

The main difficulty lied in accessing the file through the terminal which I have actually never used before. One of the main errors I encountered was downloading a X11 display program which only after googling did I realise that it referred to a graphical interface. So, really the Java application had no means of displaying itself unless I installed the requisite package. Once, that was up and running debugging the program was easy which I edited using the nano command on the terminal.
