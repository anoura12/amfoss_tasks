# ProjectEuler Tasks
## Euler 001
This task required only one condition and that is to extract all multiples of 3 or 5 upto a certain number which can be done using modulus.
Other blocks of code were for constraints. I did face a runtime error for only 2 cases.

## Euler 002
There were two parts to this problem:-
1. Create the Fibonnaci Series ( Done this using a for loop)
2. Run each element through a condition checking whether they are a multiple of 2.

# Euler 003
Again two primary parts to this:-
1. Checking if a number was a factor
2. Checking if that factor was prime.

A nested for loop did the trick. Again there was runtime error with 2 cases
